            <h3>The Creation of Humanity</h3>
            <p>
                Greek Mythology credits <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span> for giving life to humanity by forming them with clay.
                Along with his brother Epimetheus, <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span> shaped all creatures with Earth and Clay.
                However, when Epimetheus gave creatures qualities like strength and speed, he ran out of gifts when he got to humans, leaving them
                weak and defenseless.

            <h3>The Gift of Fire</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span> saw that humans lived in darkness and fear.
                Feeling pity for them, he went up Mount Olympus and stole the gift of Fire from the Gods.
                Humans used fire to cook food, forge tools, and further their technology, civilization, and knowledge. 
                <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span> felt pity for humanity, seeing that they were living in darkness and ignorance.
                This was the start of humanity's progress as a civilization.

            <h3>Prometheus' Punishment</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span> stole fire from the Gods, and for this he was chained to a rock by Zeus.
                Bound to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains, he was tortured by an eagle for eternity.

            <h3>12 Labors of Hercules</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span>' eternal suffering continued until his eventual freedom by Hercules.
                This rescue was a part of the famous 12 labors of Hercules, where he killed the eagle that tortured <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span> and freed him.
                <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span>' suffering continued for many years until he was eventually freed by the hero Hercules, son of Zeus.

            <h3>Prometheus' Legacy</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Prometheus</span> is regarded as a symbol of rebellion against oppresion and tyranny. 
                His suffering is a theme for willpower against oppresion, where he was chained to a rock for eternity.
                It also symbolizes humanity's progress against the force of nature.
